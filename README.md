# Mac Hori USB Controller
I only had access to a mac and a hori fighting commander for switch. This allows me to use the two together.
Maps inputs to Keyboard buttons - which buttons it maps to are not customizable at the moment.

## Supports
* Hori Fighting commander (switch)
* Possibly other Hori switch devices?
